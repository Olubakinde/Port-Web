            <h1>Bank Account Management System</h1>
            <p>Welcome to my Bank Account Management System. Below, you'll find details about the system, its core functionalities, and the design approach.</p>

                <h2>How It Was Built</h2>
                <p>This system is built using TypeScript and provides a comprehensive solution for managing bank accounts. It includes an Account class for handling individual accounts and a Bank class for managing multiple accounts. Key functionalities include creating accounts, depositing and withdrawing funds, checking balances, and transferring funds between accounts.</p>

                <h2>Core Functionalities</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Create Accounts:</strong> Allows for the creation of new bank accounts with initial details.</li>
                    <li><strong>Deposit Funds:</strong> Enables adding funds to an account.</li>
                    <li><strong>Withdraw Funds:</strong> Allows withdrawing funds from an account, with checks for sufficient balance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Check Balance:</strong> Provides the current balance of an account.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transfer Funds:</strong> Facilitates transferring funds between different accounts within the same bank.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Design Approach</h2>
                <p>The system is designed with a modular approach, using TypeScript classes to encapsulate account and bank operations. This ensures that the system is maintainable and scalable. Key considerations include user-friendly interfaces, robust error handling, and efficient data management.</p>

                <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ensuring accurate calculations and data consistency across multiple operations.</li>
                    <li>Designing a flexible system that can be easily extended with additional functionalities.</li>
                    <li>Testing and debugging to handle various edge cases and user scenarios.</li>
                </ul>
