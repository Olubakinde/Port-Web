                <h2>How It Was Built</h2>
                <p>This Weather App is a web application designed to provide real-time weather information based on user input. It utilizes a weather API to fetch data such as current weather conditions, wind speed, and humidity for a specified location. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user-friendly interface and ensure smooth functionality.</p>

                <h2>Core Functionalities</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Real-Time Weather Information:</strong> Provides up-to-date weather data for any location entered by the user.</li>
                    <li><strong>Weather API Integration:</strong> Fetches current weather conditions, wind speed, and humidity from a reliable weather API.</li>
                    <li><strong>User Input Handling:</strong> Allows users to input a location and retrieves the corresponding weather information.</li>
                    <li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> Incorporates error handling to manage cases where data retrieval fails or user input is invalid.</li>
                </ul>
