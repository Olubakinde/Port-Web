                <h2>How I Built It</h2>
                <p>Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I developed an interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game where the AI makes decisions based on a set algorithm. The game features an intuitive user interface and real-time feedback.</p>

                <h2>Logic Behind the Game</h2>
                <p>The game logic involves a combination of simple algorithms and heuristics to ensure that the AI can make strategic moves. The AI evaluates possible moves and chooses the optimal one to either win or block the player.</p>

                <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Implementing an efficient algorithm for the AI to ensure it plays optimally.</li>
                    <li>Ensuring a smooth and responsive user interface across different devices.</li>
                    <li>Debugging and testing various scenarios to refine the AI's decision-making process.</li>
                </ul>
