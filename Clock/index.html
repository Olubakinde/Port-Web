            <p>Welcome to my Clock Project. Below, you'll find details about the project, its core functionalities, and the design approach.</p>

                <h2>How It Was Built</h2>
                <p>This Clock Project is a dynamic web-based clock built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It visually represents the time with clock hands that move in real-time, mimicking an analog clock. The clock is styled using CSS for a modern look and feel, while JavaScript handles the time calculations and updates the clock hands accordingly.</p>

                <h2>Core Functionalities</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Real-Time Updates:</strong> The clock updates in real-time, reflecting the current time with accurate hour, minute, and second hands.</li>
                    <li><strong>Analog Style:</strong> The design resembles an analog clock, with hands that move smoothly and accurately.</li>
                    <li><strong>CSS Styling:</strong> The clock is styled with modern CSS techniques to enhance its visual appeal.</li>
                    <li><strong>JavaScript Integration:</strong> JavaScript is used to calculate the current time and update the position of the clock hands.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Design Approach</h2>
                <p>The clock is designed to be both functional and visually appealing. The CSS styles are used to create a clean and modern look, while JavaScript ensures that the time is displayed accurately. The clock hands move smoothly, providing a realistic representation of time passing.</p>

                <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ensuring smooth movement of clock hands to reflect real-time accurately.</li>
                    <li>Designing a responsive and visually pleasing clock face.</li>
                    <li>Handling time calculations and updates efficiently with JavaScript.</li>
                </ul>
