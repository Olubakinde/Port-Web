                <h2>How It Was Built</h2>
                <p>The Image Transition web application is designed to provide a smooth and visually appealing effect of transitioning between images. The application utilizes HTML for the structure, CSS for styling and animations, and JavaScript for controlling the transitions. Users can view a series of images with a smooth fade or slide effect, enhancing the visual experience.</p>

                <h2>Core Functionalities</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Image Transition Effects:</strong> Images smoothly transition from one to another using CSS transitions or animations controlled by JavaScript.</li>
                    <li><strong>Interactive Controls:</strong> Users can interact with controls (such as buttons or sliders) to manually trigger transitions between images.</li>
                    <li><strong>Automatic Slideshow:</strong> The application can automatically cycle through images at a defined interval, providing a dynamic slideshow experience.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Design Approach</h2>
                <p>The design focuses on creating a visually engaging experience with smooth and fluid transitions between images. CSS is used to achieve the transition effects, while JavaScript handles user interactions and automatic transitions. The design emphasizes simplicity and elegance to keep the focus on the image content.</p>

                <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ensuring smooth and seamless transitions between images without noticeable glitches or delays.</li>
                    <li>Implementing interactive controls that are intuitive and responsive for users.</li>
                    <li>Balancing performance and visual quality to maintain a smooth user experience across different devices and browsers.</li>
                </ul>
